PILCO Reproduction README

To install PILCO and its dependencies run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop

It is recommended to install everything in a fresh conda environment with `python>=3.7`

All the reproduction scripts can be found in the folder 'examples'.
For the paper we created all the files named swing_up*.py.
The examples folder also contains other environments not shown in the paper.

The results and processing for those results used in the paper can be found in the 'results' folder.

Note that a run of a single file can take up to a couple of hours depending on the machine it's ran on.

For any questions feel free to contact us,
